# Modules

Hands-on exercises for each module of the [Developer Learning Path](https://malston.github.io/claude-code-wiki/training/developer-path/).

| Module                     | Directory          | Focus                                |

| 3. Test-Driven Development | `03-tdd/`          | Using tests as requirements          |
| 4. Debugging               | `04-debugging/`    | Systematic troubleshooting           |

Each directory has a `README.md` with exercise instructions. Work through them in module order -- later modules build on earlier ones.
